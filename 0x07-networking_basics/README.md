# 0x07. Networking Basics #0 üåê

In this project, we explore fundamental concepts of networking. Through hands-on tasks, we'll understand the OSI model, types of networks, IP addresses, the difference between TCP and UDP, and more.

## üöÄ Tasks

### [0. OSI model](0-OSI_model)
Understanding the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model which describes layered communication and network design. The task will delve into the:
- Lowest level, layer 1, which deals with transmission on physical layers.
- Highest level, layer 7, which focuses on application-specific communication.

### [1. Types of network](1-types_of_network)
Differentiate between LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network) and how they interplay with the Internet.

### [2. MAC and IP address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)
Unearth the significance of MAC addresses and IP addresses in networking. Understand their unique roles and differences.

### [3. UDP and TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)
Dive deep into understanding the protocols UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Explore their mechanisms and differences.

### [4. TCP and UDP ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
Highlight the importance of TCP and UDP ports in networking. Understand how packets use these ports to enter network devices and familiarize with commonly used ports.

### [5. Is the host on the network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
Experiment with the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to determine if a device is present on a network. Practice the `ping` command and understand its importance.
